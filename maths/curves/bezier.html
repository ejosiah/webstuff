				<h2>Linear Bézier Curves</h2>
				<p>Let’s start with the simplest case, where there are only two control points P0 and P1.</p>
				<canvas id="linear-bezier" width="200" height="200">

				<p>The Bézier curve c approximating P0 and P1 is, simply, the straight line segment joining the two. We write the parametric equation of c as follows:</p>
				<p class="block-formula">$c(u) = (1 - u)P_{0} + uP_{1}$ <span class="inline">where $(0 \leq u \leq 1)$</span><span class="inline">(1)</span></p>
				<p>The parametric equation (1.0) can be written as</p>
				<p class="block-formula">$c(u) = B_{0,1}(u)P_{0} + B_{1,1}(u)P_{1}$ <span class="inline">where $(0 \leq u \leq 1)$</span><span class="inline">(2)</span></p>
				<p>where 1 - u (of the first control point) and u (of the second control point)  are know as the <spam class="highlight_it">Bernstein polynomials</spam> of degree 1. They are denoted by $B_{0,1}$ and $B_{1,1}$</p>

					Consider next three control points P0, P1 and P2. We want to construct the Bézier curve approximating these control points by means of a process of linear interpolation. Is there, though, an evident way to linearly interpolate a curve between three control points “simultaneously”? What does this even mean?
					A possibility, of course, is to linearly interpolate between P0 and P1 and then between P1 and P2, to get the two-segment polyline P0P1P2, which is not particularly attractive because of the corner at P1 (see Figure 15.3(a)). De Casteljau’s method, however, succeeds by adding a third interpolation step to “amalgamate” the two segments P0P1 and P1P2, smoothening thereby the corner. Here’s how it works.

				<p>(a) An “unhappy” way of approximating three control points (b) c(u) describes a Bézier curve of degree 2 interpolating $P_{0}$, $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ after a “triple” interpolation (c) Bernstein polynomials of degree 2: $B_{0,2}(u) = (1 - u)^{2}$, $B_{1,2}(u) = 2(1 - u)u$, $B_{2,2}(u) = u^{2}$</p>
				<p>Given a u, $0 \leq u \leq 1$</p>
				<ol>
					<li>First interpolate between $P_{0}$ and $P_{1}$ to find the point
						<ul><li>$a(u) = (1 - u)P_{0} + uP_{1}$</li></ul>
					</li>
					<li>Next interpolate between $P_{1}$ and $P_{2}$ to find the point
						<ul><li>$b(u) = (1 - u)P_{1} + uP_{2}$</li></ul>
					</li>
					<li>Finally interpolate between a(u) and  to determine the point
						<ul><li>$c(u) = (1 - u)a(u) + ub(u)$</li></ul>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Substituting the expressions for a(u) and b(u) into that for c(u), one obtains the parametric equation for a curve c:</p>
				<p class="block-formula">$c(u) = (1 - u)^{2}P_{0} + 2(1 - u)uP_{1} + u^{2}P_{2}$ <span class="inline">where $(0 \leq u \leq 1)$</span><span class="inline">(3)</span></p>
